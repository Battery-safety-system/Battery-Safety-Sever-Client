Modbus disconnect: 1. The reason Why Modbus disconnect automatically is because I set relay off before modbus off
In dangerous State, the program will exit: 1. because I close the modbus, instrument will not work, so it will close soon; 
temp: dangerous to security has some problem: problem1: if the modbus off, what should I do next; 
Problem3: temp dangerous;  
modbusHandler: run()(collectData -> updateCurrent -> conflict with setDischarge); 
it alawys diconnect when temp dangerous? why? 
rasie Exception when temperature vio -> updatecurrent; 
send content Error: receive content truncate; and there is no send content at all. please check it;


exception:
1. if client-version5: dictContent = {self.label_list[i]: self.data_list[i] for i in range(len(self.label_list))} error!!:
directly return;


what error the system cannot do:
1. modbus cannot close;
2. relay cannot close;


isPUMPFanOFF
isPUMPFAnOn doens't work as we want


checkpart: from bottom to upline: 
content should more than 8000



1. interval should depend on list 11
2. check the dangeroius warning status again
3. checkif modbushandler should be bottom to upper 1
4. check serverConnection the 9000 works well ? doesn't I recommand to split the
5. set the 15.25 at first.not 0: set the first element at the begining
6. print power, current, votlage status(dangerous warning), device status
7. why the server program print out 
BMU01_Discharge_Ah_from_BMU: 1277622
BMU02_Discharge_Ah_from_BMU: 1560293
BMU03_Discharge_Ah_from_BMU: 1185413
BMU04_Discharge_Ah_from_BMU: 1688172
BMU05_Discharge_Ah_from_BMU: 1776467
BMU06_Discharge_Ah_from_BMU: 1115661
BMU07_Discharge_Ah_from_BMU: 922385
BMU08_Discharge_Ah_from_BMU: 1925050

new task: 
update the current function?
settime if it works
loop need to optimize

new Exception: 
1. when people set the wrong number(too much) we should raise error and exit! completed
2. print information: status error,  completed; client completed
3. don't use the thonny but use the command line;  completed;
4. update the currentlist and power list; completed
5. server code doesn't exit: better add thread, if it doesn't work, then exit the old thread and create new thread;  this is for server; completed;
6. for client, only monitor status once;  completed
7. we shouldn't wait such long time for PC connection; I already change the code, may be we can try again; completed;
8. pcan variable to config files;  completed
9. pcan reading times: 3; completed
10. I don't want the print modbuspower part 1 loop delay from status: normal state; 

I find although I don't see anything in server, but it still running, I guess it's because new thread run same way

11.set the print to the monitor
